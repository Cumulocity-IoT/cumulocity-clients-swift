/// An acceleration sensor, or accelerometer, is a device that measures acceleration along an axis. This sensor model does not define the direction of that axis. The units for this sensor type are metres per second per second (m/s2). In a managed object, an acceleration sensor is modeled as a simple empty fragment.
