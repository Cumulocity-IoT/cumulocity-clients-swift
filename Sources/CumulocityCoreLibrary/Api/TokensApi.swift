	/// Create a notification token
	/// Create a new JWT (JSON web token) access token which can be used to establish a successful WebSocket connection to read a sequence of notifications.
	/// 
	/// In general, each request to obtain an access token consists of:
	/// 
	/// *  The subscriber name which the client wishes to be identified with.
	/// *  The subscription name. This value must be associated with a subscription that's already been created and in essence, the obtained token will give the ability to read notifications for the subscription that is specified here.
	/// *  The token expiration duration.
