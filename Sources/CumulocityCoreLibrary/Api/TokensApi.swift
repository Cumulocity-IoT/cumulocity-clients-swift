/// In order to receive subscribed notifications, a consumer application or microservice must obtain an authorization token that provides proof that the holder is allowed to receive subscribed notifications.
public class TokensApi: AdaptableApi {

	/// Create a notification token
	/// Create a new JWT (JSON web token) access token which can be used to establish a successful WebSocket connection to read a sequence of notifications.
	/// 
	/// In general, each request to obtain an access token consists of:
	/// 
	/// *  The subscriber name which the client wishes to be identified with.
	/// *  The subscription name. This value must be associated with a subscription that's already been created and in essence, the obtained token will give the ability to read notifications for the subscription that is specified here.
	/// *  The token expiration duration.
	/// 
	/// <section><h5>Required roles</h5>
	/// ROLE_NOTIFICATION_2_ADMIN
	/// </section>
	/// 
	/// The following table gives an overview of the possible response codes and their meanings.
	/// - Returns:
	/// 	- 200
	///		  A notification token was created.
	/// 	- 401
	///		  Authentication information is missing or invalid.
	/// 	- 403
	///		  Not enough permissions/roles to perform this operation.
	/// 	- 422
	///		  Unprocessable Entity â€“ invalid payload.
	/// - Parameters:
	/// 	- body 
	/// 	- xCumulocityProcessingMode 
	///		  Used to explicitly control the processing mode of the request. See [Processing mode](#processing-mode) for more details.
